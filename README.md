# Bamboo

A wordpress theme development boilerplate in MVC design pattern developed with [Twig] template engine, inspired by [Sprig].

## Why the name Bamboo?

Since it is developed with Twig template engine, I have chosen a name of the tree, Bamboo for this project.

### Note

The project is in its very initial stage and is not ready for use.
